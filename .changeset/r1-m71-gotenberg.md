The Gotenberg DOCGEN adapter (OWNER-QUESTIONS #120, R1-D-100; R1-plan M71): `GotenbergDocgen` (`@infrabyx/connectors/docgen`) renders `renderHtml` requests to PDF or PDF/A (PDF/A-2b with PDF/UA) through an in-cluster Gotenberg's Chromium route, so Hindi, Punjabi and other Indic text is shaped with the Noto fonts in its image (`fonts-noto-core`); the PDF goes to the tenant's STORAGE under the request's output prefix with its SHA-256 and page count. It sends one `index.html` and nothing else, fails on console exceptions, talks HTTPS to its configured host only, and is off behind the new setting `int.docgen.gotenberg.enabled` (PLATFORM, default false, R4). The template methods are declared unsupported. `@infrabyx/testing` adds `docgenHtmlContractCases` and the pinned `gotenberg` test image (8.39.0); `port-contract` gains a DOCGEN leg; `PORT_EXIT` has the DOCGEN entry. With `renderPdf` from `@infrabyx/export`, vernacular KFS and notices render for every product.
