Per-object retention that is only ever extended (Finbyx PR-FBX-27; IPB-01-29; R1-D-42). `StoragePort.extendRetention(key, retainUntil)` (S3 `PutObjectRetention` in COMPLIANCE mode; an earlier or equal date, or an object without retention, is refused with `IPB-STOR-003`) and `retentionOf(key)`, on the `s3` and `minio` adapters and `MemoryStorage`, with a shared contract case. `assertImmutable` now also checks the stored SHA-256 checksum against the hash recorded at write, from a HEAD with checksum mode, so no decrypt permission is needed. `putWithRetention` stays one single-part write with the lock mode, the date and a SHA-256 checksum.
